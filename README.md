# QuartzScheduler
.NET example of incorporating the [QuartzScheduler](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/) into an ASP.NET 6 web application.  The scheduler is configured to run two jobs.  An hourly job to pull down the latest observation which uses the [SimpleTrigger](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/documentation/quartz-3.x/tutorial/simpletriggers.html).  There is also a daily job that pulls down the forecast as of 08:15 that uses the [CronTrigger](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/documentation/quartz-3.x/tutorial/simpletriggers.html).

The API is built using [Minimal APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0) and a developer friendly [Swagger UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger?view=aspnetcore-6.0).  The two endpoints implemented in the project provide the ability to get a list of all scheduled jobs and add a new job based on the currently scheduled ones.  The data retrieved is either METAR, encoded weather observation, or TAF, encoded weather forecast.  The API implementation also provides and example on how to utilize dependency injection in the endpoints by passing in the `ISchedulerFactory` instance.

The weather data retrieved is for the [ICAO](https://www.icao.int/about-icao/Pages/default.aspx), International Civil Aviation Organization, identifier KPHL, Philadelphia Internationa Airport.  For a listing of some of the popular ICAO identifiers in the USA take a looks at the [Aviation Weather Center](https://aviationweather.gov/metar/info) site.  All airports around the world are associated with an ICAO identifier so there should be one near you that you could pull down an observation or forecast.
